# Low Temperature Resistance
## Summary
Second lab experiment from my second year undergraduate in Physics at The University of Manchester. All data analysis was done on excel so no .py files are included.

The aim of this experiment was to investigate the current against voltage graphs for two conductors, copper and constantan, and a diode at different temperatures. The range of temperatures were achieved using a heater, liquid nitrogen and helium as an exchange gas. The resistance of each conductor was calculated for each temperature and a relationship between temperature and resistance was quantitatively described by the temperature coefficient of resistance. Also, the energy gap for the diode was estimated from the relationship between voltage and temperature.

## Technical Highlights
