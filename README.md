Second lab experiment from my second year undergraduate in Physics at The University of Manchester. All data analysis was done on excel so no .py files are included.

* Low Temperature Resistance Lab Script.pdf contains a breif outline of the experiment given to me before I started.
* Low Temperature Resistance Of Light Notebook.pdf contains my handwritten notes from during the experiment including a schematic diagram, key figures, snippets of the recorded data, calculations, data analysis and conclusions.
* Low Temperature Resistance Of Light Lab Report.pdf contains my written up lab report from after the experiment.
